    -> Flyweight

+ 2.7. An object representing another object.
    -> Questions: 
        Do you need to control access to another object? 
        Do you want to add a level of indirection to manage access to an object?

    -> Proxy

## 3. Communication between objects
-> Questions: 
    Do your problem related to how different objects talk to each other ?
    Do your problem related to how object should behave in a certain scenarios ? 

-> **BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS**

    -> Questions: 
        Do you need to handle a request through a series of handlers? 
        Do you want to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver?

    -> Chain of Responsibility

+ 3.2. Encapsulate a command request as an object.
    -> Questions: 
        **Do you need to parameterize objects with operations? 
        Do you want to queue or log requests, or support undoable operations?

    -> Command

+ 3.3. A way to include language elements in a program.
    -> Questions: 
        Do you need to interpret sentences in a language?
        Do you have a grammar that needs to be evaluated?

    -> Interpreter

+ 3.4. Sequentially access the elements of a collection.
    -> Questions: 
        Do you need to access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation? 
        Do you want to provide a uniform way to traverse different collections?

    -> Iterator

+ 3.5. Defines simplified communication between classes.
    -> Questions: 
        Do you need to reduce the communication complexity between multiple objects or classes?
